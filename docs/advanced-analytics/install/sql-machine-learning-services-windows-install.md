# Install SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services (In-Database) on Windows 
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

The Machine Learning Services component of SQL Server adds in-database predictive analytics, statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning algorithms. Function libraries are available in R and Python and run as external script on a database engine instance. 

This article explains how to install the machine learning component by running the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup wizard, and following the on-screen prompts.

## <a name="bkmk_prereqs"> </a> Pre-install checklist

+ SQL Server 2017 setup is required if you want to install Machine Learning Services with language support for R, Python, or both. If instead you have SQL Server 2016 installation media, you can  install [SQL Server 2016 R Services (In-Database)](sql-r-services-windows-install.md) to get R language support.

+ A database engine instance is required. You cannot install just R or Python features, athough you can add them incrementally to an existing instance.

+ Do not install Machine Learning Services on a failover cluster. The security mechanism used for isolating R and Python processes is not compatible with a Windows Server failover cluster environment.

+ Do not install Machine Learning Services on a domain controller. The Machine Learning Services portion of setup will fail.

+ Do not install **Shared Features** > **Machine Learning Server (Standalone)** on the same computer running an in-database instance. A standalone server will compete for the same resources, undermining the performance of both installations.

+ Side-by-side installation with other versions of R and Python is supported but not recommended. It's supported because SQL Server instance uses its own copies of the open-source R and Anaconda distributions. But it's not recommended because running code that uses R and Python on the SQL Server computer outside SQL Server can lead to various problems:
    
  + You use a different library and different executable, and get different results, than you do when you are running in SQL Server.
  + R and Python scripts running in external libraries cannot be managed by SQL Server, leading to resource contention.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> After setup is complete, be sure to complete the post-configuration steps described in this article. These steps include enabling SQL Server to use external scripts, and adding accounts required for SQL Server to run R and Python jobs on your behalf. Configuration changes generally require a restart of the instance, or a restart of the Launchpad service.

## Get the installation media

[!INCLUDE[GetInstallationMedia](../../includes/getssmedia.md)]

## Run Setup

For local installations, you must run Setup as an administrator. If you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] from a remote share, you must use a domain account that has read and execute permissions on the remote share.

1. Start the setup wizard for SQL Server 2017. You can download 
  
2. On the **Installation** tab, select **New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installation**.

   ![Install Machine Learning Services in-database](media/2017setup-installation-page-mlsvcs.PNG)
   
3. On the **Feature Selection** page, select these options:
  
    -   **Database Engine Services**
  
         To use R and Python with SQL Server, you must install an instance of the database engine. You can use either a default or a named instance.
  
    -   **Machine Learning Services (In-Database)**
  
         This option installs the database services that support R and Python script execution.

    -   **R**

        Check this option to add the Microsoft R packages, interpreter, and open-source R. 

    -   **Python**

        Check this option to add the Microsoft Python packages, the Python 3.5 executable, and select libraries from the Anaconda distribution.
        
        ![Feature options for R and Python](media/2017setup-features-page-mls-rpy.png "Setup options for Python")

        > [!NOTE]
        > 
        > Do not select the option for **Machine Learning Server (Standalone)**. The option to install Machine Learning Server under **Shared Features** is intended for use on a separate computer.

4. On the **Consent to Install R** page, select **Accept**. This license agreement covers Microsoft R Open, which includes a distribution of the open source R base packages and tools, together with enhanced R packages and connectivity providers from the Microsoft development team.

5. On the **Consent to Install Python** page, select **Accept**. The Python open source licensing agreement also covers Anaconda and related tools, plus some new Python libraries from the Microsoft development team.
     
     ![Agreement to Python license](media/2017setup-python-license.png "License agreement for Python")
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If the computer you are using does not have internet access, you can pause setup at this point to download the installers separately. For more information, see [Install machine learning components without internet access](../install/sql-ml-component-install-without-internet-access.md).
  
     Select **Accept**, wait until the **Next** button becomes active, and then select **Next**.
  
6. On the **Ready to Install** page, verify that these selections are included, and select **Install**.
  
    + Database Engine Services
    + Machine Learning Services (In-Database)
    + R or Python, or both

    Note of the location of the folder under the path `..\Setup Bootstrap\Log` where the configuration files are stored. When setup is complete, you can review the installed components in the Summary file.


## <a name="bkmk_enableFeature"></a>Enable external script execution

1. Open [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. 

    > [!TIP]
    > You can download and install the appropriate version from this page: [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).
    > 
    > You can also try out the preview release of [SQL Operations Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/sql-operations-studio/what-is), which supports administrative tasks and queries against SQL Server.
  
2. Connect to the instance where you installed Machine Learning Services, click **New Query** to open a query window, and run the following command:

   ```SQL
   sp_configure
   ```

    The value for the property, `external scripts enabled`, should be **0** at this point. That is because the feature is turned off by default. The feature must be explicitly enabled by an administrator before you can run R or Python scripts.
    
3.  To enable the external scripting feature, run the following statement:
    
    ```SQL
    EXEC sp_configure  'external scripts enabled', 1
    RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE
    ```
    
    If you have already enabled the feature for the R language, don't run reconfigure a second time for Python. The underlying extensibility platform supports both languages.

4. Restart the SQL Server service for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. Restarting the SQL Server service also automatically restarts the related [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)] service.

    You can restart the service using the right-click **Restart** command for the instance in SSMS, or by using the **Services** panel in Control Panel, or by using [SQL Server Configuration Manager](../../relational-databases/sql-server-configuration-manager.md).

## Verify installation

Use the following steps to verify that all components used to launch external script are running.

1. In SQL Server Management Studio, open a new query window, and run the following command:
    
    ```SQL
    EXEC sp_configure  'external scripts enabled'
    ```

    The **run_value** should now be set to 1.
    
2. Open the **Services** panel or SQL Server Configuration Manager, and verify **SQL Server Launchpad service** is running. You should have one service for every database engine instance that has R or Python installed. Restart the service if is not running. For more information, see [Components to support Python integration](../python/new-components-in-sql-server-to-support-python-integration.md). 
   
3. If Launchpad is running, you should be able to run simple R and Python scripts to verify that external scripting runtimes can communicate with SQL Server.

   Open a new **Query** window in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], and then run a script such as the following:
    
    + For R
    
    ```SQL
    EXEC sp_execute_external_script  @language =N'R',
    @script=N'
	OutputDataSet <- InputDataSet;
	',
    @input_data_1 =N'SELECT 1 AS hello'
    WITH RESULT SETS (([hello] int not null));
    GO
    ```

    + For Python
    
    ```SQL
    EXEC sp_execute_external_script  @language =N'Python',
    @script=N'
	OutputDataSet = InputDataSet;
	',
    @input_data_1 =N'SELECT 1 AS hello'
    WITH RESULT SETS (([hello] int not null));
    GO
    ```

 **Results**

    The script can take a little while to run, the first time the external script runtime is loaded. The results should be something like this:

    | hello |
    |----|
    | 1|


> [!NOTE]
> Columns or headings used in the Python script are not returned, by design. To add column names for your output, you must specify the schema for the return data set. Do this by using the WITH RESULTS parameter of the stored procedure, naming the columns and specifying the SQL data type.
> 
> For example, you can add the following line to generate an arbitrary column name: `WITH RESULT SETS ((Col1 AS int))`

## Additional configuration

If the external script verification step was successful, you can run Python commands from SQL Server Management Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other client that can send T-SQL statements to the server.

If you got an error when running the command, review the additional configuration steps in this section. You might need to make additional appropriate configurations to the service or database.

Common scenarios that require additional changes include:

* [Configure Windows firewall for in-bound connections](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access.md)
* [Enable additional network protocols](../../database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol.md)
* [Enable remote connections](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-remote-access-server-configuration-option.md)
* [Extend built-in permissions to remote users](#bkmk_configureAccounts)
* [Grant permission to run external scripts](#permissions-external-script)
* [Grant access to individual databases](#permissions-db)

> [!NOTE]
> Not all the listed changes are required, and none might be required. Requirements depend on your security schema, where you installed SQL Server, and how you expect users to connect to the database and run external scripts. Additional troubleshooting tips can be found here: [Upgrade and installation FAQ](../r/upgrade-and-installation-faq-sql-server-r-services.md)

###  <a name="bkmk_configureAccounts"></a> Enable implied authentication for Launchpad account group

During setup, a number of new Windows user accounts are created for the purpose of running tasks under the security token of the [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad_md](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)] service. When a user sends a Python or R script from an external client, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] activates an available worker account. Then it maps it to the identity of the calling user, and runs the script on behalf of the user.

This is called *implied authentication*, and is a service of the database engine. This service supports secure execution of external scripts in SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017.

You can view these accounts in the Windows user group, **SQLRUserGroup**. By default, 20 worker accounts are created, which is usually more than enough for running external script jobs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The worker group is named **SQLRUserGroup** regardless of whether you installed R or Python. There is a single group for each instance.

If you need to run scripts from a remote data science client, and you are using Windows authentication, there are additional considerations. These worker accounts must be given permission to sign in to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance on your behalf.

1. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], in Object Explorer, expand **Security**. Then right-click **Logins**, and select **New Login**.
2. In the **Login - New** dialog box, select **Search**.
3. Select **Object Types**, and select **Groups**. Clear everything else.
4. In **Enter the object name to select**, type *SQLRUserGroup*,  and select **Check Names**.
5. The name of the local group associated with the instance's Launchpad service should resolve to something like *instancename\SQLRUserGroup*. Select **OK**.
6. By default, the group is assigned to the **public** role, and has permission to connect to the database engine.
7. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a **SQL login** for running scripts in a SQL Server compute context, this extra step is not required.

### <a name="permissions-external-script"></a> Give users permission to run external scripts

If you installed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] yourself, and you are running R or Python scripts in your own instance, you typically execute scripts as an administrator. Thus, you have implicit permission over various operations and all data in the database.

Most users, however, do not have such elevated permissions. For example, users in an organization who use SQL logins to access the database generally do not have elevated permissions. Therefore, for each user who is using R or Python, you must grant users of Machine Learning Services the permission to run external scripts in each database where the language is used. Here's how:

```SQL
USE <database_name>
GO
GRANT EXECUTE ANY EXTERNAL SCRIPT  TO [UserName]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Permissions are not specific to the supported script language. In other words, there are not separate permission levels for R script versus Python script. If you need to maintain separate permissions for these languages, install R and Python on separate instances.

### <a name="permissions-db"></a> Give your users read, write, or data definition language (DDL) permissions to databases

While a user is running scripts, the user might need to read data from other databases. The user might also need to create new tables to store results, and write data into tables.

For each Windows user account or SQL login that is running R or Python scripts, ensure that it has the appropriate permissions on the specific database:  `db_datareader`, `db_datawriter`, or `db_ddladmin`.

For example, the following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statement gives the SQL login *MySQLLogin* the rights to run T-SQL queries in the *ML_Samples* database. To run this statement, the SQL login must already exist in the security context of the server.

```SQL
USE ML_Samples
GO
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', 'MySQLLogin'
```

For more information about the permissions included in each role, see [Database-level roles](../../relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles.md).


### Create an ODBC data source for the instance on your data science client

You might create a machine learning solution on a data science client computer. If you need to run code by using the SQL Server computer as the compute context, you have two options: access the instance by using a SQL login, or by using a Windows account.

+ For SQL logins: Ensure that the login has appropriate permissions on the database where you are reading data. You can do this by adding *Connect to* and *SELECT* permissions, or by adding the login to the `db_datareader` role. To create objects, assign `DDL_admin` rights. If you must save data to tables, add to the `db_datawriter` role.

+ For Windows authentication: You might need to create an ODBC data source on the data science client that specifies the instance name and other connection information. For more information, see [ODBC data source administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/odbc/admin/odbc-data-source-administrator).

## Suggested optimizations

Now that you have everything working, you might also want to optimize the server to support machine learning, or install pretrained models.

### Add more worker accounts

If you expect many users to be running scripts concurrently, you can increase the number of worker accounts that are assigned to the Launchpad service. For more information, see [Modify the user account pool for SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../r/modify-the-user-account-pool-for-sql-server-r-services.md).

### Optimize the server for script execution

The default settings for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup are intended to optimize the balance of the server for a variety of services that are supported by the database engine, which might include extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes, reporting, auditing, and applications that use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data. Therefore, under the default settings, you might find that resources for machine learning are sometimes restricted or throttled, particularly in memory-intensive operations.

To ensure that machine learning jobs are prioritized and resourced appropriately, we recommend that you use SQL Server Resource Governor to configure an external resource pool. You might also want to change the amount of memory that's allocated to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database engine, or increase the number of accounts that run under the [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)] service.

- To configure a resource pool for managing external resources, see [Create an external resource pool](../../t-sql/statements/create-external-resource-pool-transact-sql.md).
  
- To change the amount of memory reserved for the database, see [Server memory configuration options](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md).
  
- To change the number of R accounts that can be started by [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)], see [Modify the user account pool for machine learning](../r/modify-the-user-account-pool-for-sql-server-r-services.md).

If you are using Standard Edition and do not have Resource Governor, you can use Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and Extended Events, as well as Windows event monitoring, to help manage the server resources. For more information, see [Monitoring and managing R Services](../r/managing-and-monitoring-r-solutions.md) and [Monitoring and managing Python Services](../python/managing-and-monitoring-python-solutions.md).

### Install additional R packages

The R solutions you create for SQL Server can call basic R functions, functions from the properietary packes installed with SQL Server, and third-party R packages compatible with the version of open-source R installed by SQL Server.

Packages that you want to use from SQL Server must be installed in the default library that is used by the instance. If you have a separate installation of R on the computer, or if you installed packages to user libraries, you won't be able to use those packages from T-SQL.

The process for installing and managing R packages is different in SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017. In SQL Server 2016, a database administrator must install R packages that users need. In SQL Server 2017, you can set up user groups to share packages on a per-database level, or configure database roles to enable users to install their own packages. For more information, see [Package management](../r/r-package-management-for-sql-server-r-services.md).
